# Role-chain experiment

This is a standalone, undeployed prototype, not the production entry point.
It does not import the previous worker or runner. It is not a claim that an
arbitrary request will finish unattended or reach a live delivery target.

The original request and ordinary prose reports go to a routing model. The
router invokes a configured role; the role runs an existing agent harness and
returns its own words. There are no candidate/review schemas, signatures,
confidence thresholds, or content-based output gates. A native API choice or
function call identifies which configured action to execute, not whether a
working role's answer passes a certificate check.

## Current executable

From this directory:

```sh
go run ./cmd/engine --config operator.json --request request.txt --run-dir run
# Or read an issue's original title and description:
go run ./cmd/engine --config operator.json --issue EXAMPLE-1 --run-dir run
```

`operator.json` configures `router.mode` (`jev` or `llm`), routing endpoints,
credential environment-variable names, and `roles`. Each role has a name,
purpose, and one or more processes. A process specifies an argv array,
directory, explicit environment, and named credential sources. Standard input
carries the original request, current assignment, and previous reports without
shell interpolation. Use the existing harness's final-response interface;
do not assume that a CLI's `--quiet` flag removes reasoning displays or other
UI output. A live experiment found that those displays inflated the next
role's context. Its thin native SDK adapter forwards the complete final prose
on stdout and diagnostics on stderr, without classifying the answer.

Multiple processes for one role run independently with the same prior history.
They do not see one another's current report. A Jev transport/context failure
can use the configured ordinary-LLM router. Role errors and timeouts become
observations for the next decision; there is no attempt-count terminal.

History is saved before dispatch and after return. A restart after an
interrupted action tells the router that the action may already have happened;
it must inspect before repeating it. A temporary result-save failure retries
the save, not the external action. Only one process owns a run directory.

## What the tests establish

```sh
GOMAXPROCS=2 go test -p 1 -count=1 ./...
GOMAXPROCS=2 go test -race -p 1 -count=1 ./...
```

Tests use API fixtures, local TLS servers, and real local child processes. They
cover original prose delivery, preservation of early objections, free-form and
failed role outputs, transient storage failures inside the chain, cancellation,
restart observations, independent reviewers, credential isolation/redaction,
redirect refusal, and routing fallback. They do not establish real model
judgment or real tracker-to-production delivery. A fixture choosing `done` is
only an executable-wiring test.

## Isolated live observations

Two fresh live-model runs used the real engine run path and an installed native
agent's tool loop to repair a small CSV CLI, obtain two independent model reviews,
build a real zipapp, execute that artifact, and write the requested report.
Neither run needed manual repair or restart after it began. Both routers chose
done, and both artifacts passed 10 separate post-run inputs. However, a further
comparison with the original exposed a regression in both artifacts: a plain
CSV cell with 131,073 characters worked before and now raises a field-limit
error. A review in the ordinary-LLM run even mentioned the regression but
dismissed it as outside scope despite the request to preserve ordinary input.

These are **not accepted completions**. Reaching the report stage and passing
the initial examples did not establish the full requested behavior. Review
context and handling of objections need further live investigation, not a
new answer-format or content-certification gate.

For these single trials, Jev routing took about six minutes and ordinary-LLM
routing about fourteen. The latter selected extra investigation/verification
steps, and the working roles also took different amounts of time. This is not
evidence of a general speed advantage or an optimal routing architecture.

The run used a test binary whose only substitution was trusting a local TLS
relay certificate; it did not substitute the models, router or agent execution.
This was file-based intake, not the live tracker path.

This is one local task, not a production acceptance or proof of reliable
completion. Earlier integration attempts required manual sandbox/TLS setup
repairs, and a resumed run's report incorrectly claimed the test suite emitted
no stderr. Those attempts are not counted as clean unattended completions.
The experiment launcher, native adapter and role sandbox are not yet packaged
as a supported deployment. No existing production entry point was replaced.

## Still missing before production use

- Automatic intake/claiming, isolated per-request checkout, tracker stop and
  final-comment posting/readback, and live delivery integration.
- Repair and retest the observed premature completion: reviewers must compare
  relevant original behavior and preserve objections against the actual request.
  Broader validation still needs misleading reports, repeated failures and restart.
- Automatic model selection from a freshly fetched catalog. Prototype config
  currently names experiment models explicitly. These names are not a durable
  shortlist; refresh the available model list on each selection, initially use
  current Chinese frontier/value candidates, and do not call a saved snapshot
  current when retrieval fails.
- Production isolation. Restricting child environment variables does not
  sandbox filesystem/network access; the configured launcher must enforce the
  role's actual permissions. Do not run unconfined commands with broad keys.
- Startup acquisition/configuration/storage errors currently return from the
  CLI. Retry coverage inside `Chain.Run` is not startup recovery. Process output
  is buffered in memory; production resource behavior has not been exercised.

Jev routing is one comparison candidate, not a settled architecture decision.
